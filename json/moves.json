This does not refer to the Base Stats for the Hit Points but rather the opponent's HP relative to its maximum at the current point in time.\n\nWith this in mind, a simple equation is made to determine the base power of the attack\n\n    Base Power = 110 * (Opponent's Current HP / Opponent's Max HP)\n\nSo for example if we were battling a Max IV'd, Max EV'd Torterra at Level 100 and it had just over half its HP remaining, it would be as such\n\n    Base Power = 110 * (215 / 394) = 60.03 (2 d.p.)\n\nThis shows that the best time to use Wring Out & Crush Grip would be at the start of a battle with any Pokémon, whether it has just been switched in or the battle is just beginning, in order to get the maximum Base Power.
